Note: `dbt_valid_to` can be NULL 

Here are some cases to pay attention to : 

- For members, if member changes province, his record for previous province will have an `dbt_valid_to` = When he is new province and the record for the new province will have `dbt_valid_to` = NULL
- For members, if member is not in the latest batch, meaning he/she has unsubscribed, then the previous record will have a valid `dbt_valid_to` date. 
- For organizations, if org changes programs, their record for previous program will have an `dbt_valid_to` = When they have new program and the record for the new programs will have `dbt_valid_to` = NULL
- For organizations, if they are not in the latest batch, meaning they has unsubscribed or ineligble, then the previous record will have a valid `dbt_valid_to` date. 
- For events, if for an episode_id and member_id, the status has changed the record with the pending status will be closed and have a valid `dbt_valid_to` date.

## SCD Type 2 Tracking

All dimension tables are implemented with SCD Type 2 logic to preserve historical changes. This enables:

- Accurate point-in-time joins between facts and dimensions
- Tracking member province changes over time
- Monitoring organization program evolution
- Analyzing episode lifecycle durations

---

##  Analytical Use Cases

This schema supports a wide range of business questions beyond the Monthly Utilization Rate:

###  Historical Attribution
- How did member province distributions shift over time?
- What was the organization-program mapping at the time of each episode?

###  Episode Lifecycle Analysis
- What is the average time an episode remains in `pending` status?
- How does resolution time vary by `issue_type` or `triage_recommendation`?

###  Member Behavior Insights
- How frequently do members change provinces during an episode?
- Is there a correlation between province changes and episode outcomes?

###  Operational & Strategic Impact
- Could province-level member movement impact healthcare costs or billing?
- Are certain programs more effective in resolving specific issue types?
